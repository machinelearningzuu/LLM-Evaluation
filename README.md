# LLM-Evaluation

Welcome to the "LLM-Evaluation" repository, dedicated to the evaluation of LLM Finetuning and RAG Applications. This collection of Jupyter notebooks and scripts is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the performance, robustness, and generalization capabilities of various LLMs

## What's Inside?

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Explore a suite of evaluation metrics designed to assess language models across different tasks, including natural language understanding, text generation, and question-answering.

- **Benchmarking:** Engage in benchmarking experiments to compare the performance of different LLMs under various conditions and domains.

- **Fine-tuning Analysis:** Investigate the impact of fine-tuning on LLMs, examining how it affects performance and tailoring models for specific applications.

- **RAG Evaluation:** Evaluate the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, focusing on its capabilities in information retrieval, question-answering, and text generation.

## How to Use?

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/machinelearningzuu/LLM-Evaluation.git
   cd LLM-Evaluation
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore Evaluation:**
   Open the Jupyter notebooks using your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Google Colab, etc.) and start evaluating LLMs based on the provided metrics and benchmarks.
